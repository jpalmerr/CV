I am a Mathematics graduate, who moved into software after finding inspiration in the Computational Modelling section of my course. A functional developer and machine learning enthusiast, I have been working professionally as a back end Scala engineer since August 2019.

## Experience 

#### ITV, Junior (08/19 - 04/21), Core (04/21 - Present)

Upon joining ITV, I worked on a new image rendering microservice for the Hub. The stack included Elm and bleeding edge scala library ZIO, both new to me at the time.

After 5 months, I moved to the SVOD team.
Here I was part of a small team that delivered new subscription packages and implemented a number of third party billing integrations.
I then worked within our image and content stack, integrating services using Apache Kafka.

Whilst at ITV, I received training. This included completing a 3 day workshop with Underscore's Dave Gurnell.

After 20 months I was promoted to Core Scala Engineer. My focus switched to our content api's, again engaging with 3rd parties. My role extended to helping design microservice architecture and supporting fellow engineers. I also engaged in the out of hours on call process. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (04/02/19 to 04/06/19)

After enjoying the Computational Modelling section of my university course, I spent 08/18 - 01/19 learning how to code from home, using different resources such as Safari Online, Underscore and Coursera. I joined Makers Academy (a 16 week intensive bootcamp) 02/19, deciding it was the perfect opportunity to dedicate myself to software development, gaining qualification and experience.
 
#### Newcastle University (09/15 to 06/18)

- Mathematics, with a focus on Calculus
  - Final modules include Quantum Mechanics, Computational Modelling, Coding Theory, Topology, Relativity & Cosmology.

#### Sixth Form (Graduated 07/15)

###### A-Levels
- Further Mathematics
- Mathematics
- Economics

###### AS Levels
- Sport Studies
 
## Projects

### Scala

I am constantly taking advantage of resources to improve my technical skills and widen my overall development perspective. In that resepct, I regularly use my Github as a dumping ground of information, exercises, and examples of patterns.
