## Experience 

#### ITV (08/19 - present)

My first project at ITV was to deliver a new svg image rendering microservice for the Hub, whilst also providing a UI for internal use. The stack included Elm, bleeding edge scala library, ZIO and Rabbit MQ.

After 5 months, I moved to the SVOD team.
Here I was part of a small team that delivered a new subscription package using Stripe and implemented a number of third party billing integrations.
I also worked within our image stack, integrating services using Apache Kafka.

Whilst at ITV, I received training. This included completing a 3 day workshop with Underscore's Dave Gurnell.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (04/02/19 to 04/06/19)

After enjoying the Computational Modelling section of my university course, I spent 08/18 - 01/19 learning how to code from home, using different resources such as Safari Online, Underscore and Coursera. I joined Makers Academy (a 16 week intensive bootcamp) 02/19, deciding it was the perfect opportunity to dedicate myself to software development, gaining qualification and experience.
 
#### Newcastle University (09/15 to 06/18)

- Mathematics, with a focus on Calculus
  - Final modules include Quantum Mechanics, Computational Modelling, Coding Theory, Topology, Relativity & Cosmology.

#### Sixth Form (Graduated 07/15)

###### A-Levels
- Further Mathematics
- Mathematics
- Economics

###### AS Levels
- Sport Studies
 
## Projects

I engage in multiple projects in my own time, notably working through Scala books. These projects can be found in my [github repos](https://github.com/jpalmerr?tab=repositories). I tend to focus on Cats and any libraries that can help me in my professional work.
