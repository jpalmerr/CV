I am a Mathematics graduate, who moved into software after finding inspiration in the Computational Modelling section of my course. I have being working professionally as a back end Scala engineersince August 2019, a functional developer and machine learning enthusiast.

## Experience 

#### ITV (08/19 - present)

My first project at ITV was to deliver a new microservice that applied treatments to images for the Hub, whilst also providing a UI for internal use. I was one of two working on this service. The stack included Elm and bleeding edge scala library, ZIO. The service was integrated into the existing architechture using Rabbit MQ.

After 5 months, I moved to the Britbox team.
Here I was part of a small team that delivered a new subscription package using Stripe and implemented a number of third party billing integrations within our user-stack.  

Whilst at ITV, I received training. This included completing a 3 day workshop with Underscore's Dave Gurnell.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (04/02/19 to 04/06/19)

After enjoying the Computational Modelling section of my university course, I spent 08/18 - 01/19 learning how to code from home, using different resources such as Safari Online, Underscore and Coursera. I joined Makers Academy (a 16 week intensive bootcamp) 02/19, deciding it was the perfect opportunity to dedicate myself to software development, gaining qualification and experience.
 
#### Newcastle University (09/15 to 06/18)

- Mathematics, with a focus on Calculus
  - Final modules include Quantum Mechanics, Computational Modelling, Coding Theory, Topology, Relativity & Cosmology.

#### Sixth Form (Graduated 07/15)

###### A-Levels
- Further Mathematics
- Mathematics
- Economics

###### AS Levels
- Sport Studies

###### Sports Journalism
  A personal hobby of mine is to write about sport, particularly football. I have written on sites such as SB Nation, and I use my [Medium](https://medium.com/@james6of1).
###### Football Coaching
 My role as the football coach of my local county representative side, a team I previously played for, has been a particularly rewarding process. Passing down my personal experience whilst also creating a positive atmosphere has in return taught myself a lot, improving my communication skills and providing experience of working with a range of capabilties and personalities.
###### Mental and Physical Health
 Mental health and well-being are topics particularly important to me. I have experimented with a variety of different techniques, with meditation proving very beneficial. I believe in healthy eating, using cooking as a way to unwind, and sport as a way to exercise, socialise and communicate. In addition to this I am a keen runner.
